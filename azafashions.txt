1. Introduction: 

 The domain http://www.azafashions.com including any web-pages thereof is the web-site (“Website”) of Aza Fashions Private Limited (hereinafter “Aza”, “we”, “us” or “our”) having its registered office at 39 Rajgir Chambers, Opp. Old Custom House, Shahid Bhagat Singh Marg, Mumbai 400 023, India.

 Please also read Terms and Conditions (“Terms”) and other policies as set out on the Website before proceeding to place an order. By placing a purchase order, it shall be deemed that you have read the Terms and Conditions and other policies including this policy and the same are acceptable and binding upon you.
2. Invitation of offer and Acceptance of Offer:

 All products and information displayed on Website is Aza’s invitation to offer and not an offer. Your order for purchase of any products constitutes your offer which shall be subject to Terms and the terms as listed in this policy and Aza reserves the right to accept or reject your offer in part or in full.

 Acceptance of your order for purchase by Aza will take place upon dispatch of the product(s) ordered. For avoidance of doubt, no act or omission by Aza prior to the actual dispatch of the product(s) ordered will constitute acceptance of your offer.

 Dispatch of all the product(s) ordered, may or may not happen at the same time, in such a scenario that portion of the order which has been dispatched will be deemed to have been accepted by Aza and the balance would continue to be an offer to Aza and Aza reserves the right to accept or reject such balance order.

 We may also require additional verifications or information before accepting any order. If you have provided us with your contact details such as mobile number, phone number or e-mail address, we will call you or send you an e-mail or use any other mode of communication for obtaining additional information from you to accept your order.

In case where the product(s) are sold on the Website but payment terms are ‘Cash on Delivery’ then Aza will only inform you about its inability to accept your offer.

Generally, Aza tries to verify the information coming from its suppliers, vendors, fashion designers, etc. before publishing it on the Website.

 Identification of the intellectual property claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple intellectual properties/works at a single online site is covered by a single notification, a representative list of such intellectual properties/work at that site.

 Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider to locate the material. Providing URLs in the body of an email is the best way to help us locate the content quickly.

 Information reasonably sufficient to permit us to contact the complaining party, such as an address, telephone number, and, if available, an electronic mail address.

 A statement that the complaining party has a good faith in belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.

 A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

 Before you file such a notification, please carefully consider whether or not the use of copyrighted material at issue is protected by the “fair use” doctrine, as you could be liable for costs and Attorneys’ fees, should you file a takedown notice where there is no infringing use. If you are unsure whether a use of your copyrighted material constitutes infringement, please contact an Attorney at law.

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS ON DESIGNER NEHRU JACKETS

	
1> What is a designer Nehru jacket?

	A designer Nehru jacket worn by men is a short or a medium length coat, sometimes without sleeves that is worn with kurtas and shirts. Designer Nehru jackets feature unique embellishments, high-quality fabrics and details that are durable and comfortable to wear. Their distinctive patterns and styles differentiate them from a regular Nehru jacket.

	These online designer Nehru jackets are made from several types of fabrics like Jacquard silk, matka silk, velvet, cotton, linen, wool, khadi, rayon and blends.

4> Can a Nehru jacket be worn with jeans?

	THE MODERN INDIAN WOMAN AND CLASSIC DESIGNER SAREES:

	Worn by women across India, the saree is the most recognized, loved, and popular Indian silhouette. Sarees have an understated elegance and bring a hint of poise and beauty to every woman who adorns one. Azafashions.com has the widest range of stunning designer sarees that are an absolute must-have this festive and wedding season. Our diverse selection at Aza Fashions Online includes the best 
handloom sarees
 from the 
top Indian designers
. Also, all of these are in a wide range of styles, fabrics, colors, designs, and work, including hand embroidery, applique details, embellishments, 3D motifs, prints and patterns, unusual drapes, two-tone hues, texture-play, and use of attractive handicraft techniques. Depending on the occasion, you can opt for a 
printed saree
 to keep it low-key. Or if you're feeling a little too good about yourself, don't hesitate to splurge on a 
saree gown
 that happens to be the perfect amalgamation of two of the best styles. Make heads turn with a 
ruffle saree
 and stay ahead of the fashion game. If you're a fan of the classics, we strongly suggest you opt for a 
silk saree
 that will always hold a special place in your heart.

	If you don't want the hassle of draping a saree, 
ready-to-wear sarees
 are available on Aza Fashions Online to make sure that you are all set to stand out of the crowd. Pick any saree you want and pair it with a different 
saree blouse
 to add a nice spin to your look. As a bride, traditional clothing plays an important role in making your wedding day even special, shop for the finest of paithani sarees and look straight out of a fairy tale. Sarees have recently made a comeback and have become the raging trend as the millennials and the Gen Z appreciate the finer things when it comes to 
women's fashion
. Among these existing trends, chanderi sarees are being highly praised and lauded by influencers and top-tier bloggers. As we talk about new trends, 
dhoti and pant sarees
 have also become very popular among the younger generation. Along with these, the classics like 
cotton sarees
 continue to remain our personal favorites. If you're confused about picking between a saree or a lehenga on your big day, you can opt for a lehenga saree that will make you look like a princess on your wedding day. Many designers are now blending traditional fabrics, dyes, weaves, and techniques that have long been part of Indian heritage, such as bandhani, kanjeevaram, Banarasi silk sarees, patola, leheriya, and chickankari, with modern silhouettes to create fresh new looks that are elegant, striking, yet beautifully Indian.

Frequently Asked Questions on Designer Dresses for Women

	
1. What are the different types of dress?

	When it comes to dresses, there are three main styles: maxi, short, and midi dresses as follows:

		
Maxi Dresses:
 These are long dresses that typically reach the floor or just above the ankle. They can be flowy or fitted and are often made of lightweight fabrics like silk, chiffon, and cotton. They are perfect for formal occasions or a more dressy casual event.

		
Short Dresses:
 These are dresses that typically fall above the knee. They can be flowy or fitted and can be made of various fabrics. They are perfect for casual events, parties, and special occasions.

		
Midi dresses:
 These are dresses that fall between the knee and ankle. They can be flowy or fitted and can be made of a variety of fabrics. They are perfect for events that require more formal attire and can be easily dressed up or down.

	Each style has its own unique characteristics and can be worn for different occasions; it's essential to choose the one that best suits your style and the occasion you are attending. And if you want to elevate the occasion, go for designer dresses available at Aza Fashions that are often made from high-quality fabrics and come in a range of cuts, styles, and designs, so there is something to suit every taste and body shape.

	
2. What occasions are designer dresses appropriate for?

	Designer dresses can be worn for a variety of occasions, such as formal events, parties, and red-carpet appearances. Based on the occasion, you can find bodycon dresses, A-line dresses, fit and flared dresses from the leading designers.

	
3. How to accessorize short, midi and maxi dresses?

	Accessorizing short, midi, and maxi dresses can be a great way to add a personal touch and elevate the overall look of the dress. Here are a few tips on how to accessorize each type of dress:

		
Short dresses: 
Short dresses can be paired with a wide range of accessories, including statement jewellery, such as a chunky necklace, a pair of earrings, or a bracelet. A belt can also be added to cinch in the waist and create a more defined silhouette. A couple of heels will elevate the dress for shoes, but a pair of sandals or flats can be an excellent option for a more relaxed look.

		
Midi dresses:
 Midi dresses can be paired with heels, wedges, or flats, depending on the occasion. A clutch or a small handbag can also be added for a more polished look. Statement jewellery, such as a pair of chandelier earrings or a statement necklace, can also be added to complete the look.

		
Maxi dresses:
 Maxi dresses can be dressed up or down, depending on the occasion. Pair a maxi dress with heels and statement jewellery for a more formal look. Pair a maxi dress with flats or sandals and a denim jacket for a casual look. A statement necklace or a pair of statement earrings can also be added to complete the look.

	Ultimately, the key to accessorizing is to keep the look balanced and not over-accessorize. It's important to choose the right accessories that complement the dress and the occasion and ensure they are not overpowering the dress.
